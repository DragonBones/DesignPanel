1. Make sure you have installed Flash Builder with Flex SDK 4.0 or later version.  
2. Make sure you have got [SeletonAnimationLibrary](https://github.com/DragonBones/SkeletonAnimationLibrary) project.  
3. Open Flash Builder and create a Flex project named SkeletonAnimationDesignPanel.  
4. Change project location to SkeletonAnimationDesignPanel's location to make sure the IDE can find the source code.
5  Change complie parameters to -locale en_US zh_CN ja_JP fr_FR -source-path ./locale/{locale} -allow-source-path-overlap=true
6. Import SeletonAnimationLibrary project.  
7. (Optional) Change project theme to "Graphite".  
8. Test and have fun.
